These three projects are a part of my “ Java Programming” virtual internship with “CodSoft”.<br/><br/>
TASK 1 : RandomNumberGame:<br/>  1.  The program generates a random number within 1 to 100.<br/>
                            2.  Prompts the user to enter their guess for the generated number.<br/>
                            3.  Compares the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct / high / low / too high / too low.<br/>
                            4.  The user has a total of 6 guesses.<br/><br/>

TASK 2: gradeCalculator:<br/> 1. Input: Takes marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.<br/>
                           2. Calculate Total Marks: Sums up the marks obtained in all subjects.<br/>
                           3. Calculate Average Percentage: Divides the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the
                               average percentage.<br/>
                           4. Grade Calculation: Assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved.<br/>
                           5. Display Results: Shows the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.<br/><br/>

TASK 3: ATM Interface:<br/> Created a fully functional ATM interface in java<br/>
                           1. Each user has a Register and Login feature for their account<br/>
                           2. Users can perform tasks like Deposit, Withdrawal, Fund Transfer, Check Balance.<br/><br/>
