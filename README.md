These three projects are a part of my “ Java Programming” virtual internship position with “CodSoft”.
TASK 1 : RandomNumberGame: 1: The program generates a random number within 1 to 100.
                           2: Prompts the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
                           3: Compares the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
                              is correct / high / low / too high / too low.
                           4: The user has a total of 6 guesses.

TASK 2: gradeCalculator  : 1: Input: Takes marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
                           2: Calculate Total Marks: Sums up the marks obtained in all subjects.
                           3: Calculate Average Percentage: Divides the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the
                               average percentage.
                           4: Grade Calculation: Assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved.
                           5: Display Results: Shows the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

TASK 3: ATM Interface    : Created a fully functional ATM interface in java
                           1: Each user has a Register and Login feature for their account
                           2. Users can perform tasks like Deposit, Withdrawal, Fund Transfer, Check Balance.
